# Business_Card_PCB
A personal Business Card designed as a PCB. Supports NFC to share data wirelessly on a tap.

The heart of this PCB is the NFC controller IC, the NT3H1101 from NXP Semiconductors.
You can store your contact information, link to your portfolio, social media, and so on. Your choice!!
The form factor is maintained as a standard credit/debit card, so you can carry it around normally in your wallet.

The Schematics and PCB design is done with KiCAD, the Vector graphics is done with Inkscape.

Feel free to use this as a reference and design your own Business Card PCBs!! Good Luck!!
